Although all cells have some basic parts, different types of cells have evolved over time. There are two major categories of cells, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells, that differ in their structural organization. Whereas prokaryotic cells have a simple structure, eukaryotic cells have several types of membrane-bound organelles and a nucleus. Animal and plant cells are two types of eukaryotic cell that each have some distinctive components.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    <br>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Blockquote\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The smooth ER lacks ribosomes and is involved in the synthesis of lipids (such as phospholipids, cholesterol, and steroid hormones) and the detoxification of drugs.

It is composed of three kinds of fibers: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Microfilaments (also called actin filaments) are involved in changes in cell shape, such as those that enable an amoeba to move. Intermediate filaments maintain cell shape and keep organelles in place. Microtubules form &ldquo;tracks&rdquo; that guide the movement of organelles and chromosomes within the cell. In animal cells, microtubules originate from a region of the cell called the centrosome. They cytoskeleton is dynamic, as its fibers can be broken down or built up where needed.\n\n<p>\n    Microtubules compose two types of projections used for motility in some eukaryotic cells: flagella and cilia. Some aquatic protists and most sperm cells have a flagellum, a long projection made of microtubules that propels the cell through liquid in an undulating motion (note that flagella of eukaryotic cells are structurally different from those of prokaryotes). Other aquatic protists are covered with cilia (singular: cilium), small projections that move like oars of a rowboat to propel the cell forward. Cilia are also found on cells of tissues that move substances across their surfaces. For example, the cilia of cells lining the windpipe help expel mucus from the lungs.\n<\/p>\n<script type=\"application\/json\">{\"type\":\"IMAGE\",\"filename\":\"Cell Types and Structures (Keep this valid)\\\/Content\\\/3263550.png\",\"alignment\":\"center\",\"title\":\"Basic similarities and differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell\",\"caption\":\"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.\",\"width\":125,\"height\":59}<\/script><\/div>\n","images":[{"filename":"image7.png","path":"Cell Types and Structures (Keep this valid)\/Content\/3263550.png","ext":"png","width":125,"height":59}]},{"block_type":"TableBlock","id":19,"children":[],"name":"Table","route":"\/sg\/introduction-to-biology-dev\/introduction-to-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells\/#parts-of-eukaryotic-cells","extra_properties":{"cmsItemId":5718922,"createdOn":"2018-05-10 17:12:00"},"title":"<p>\n    Main Cell Parts\n<\/p>","table":"<table>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowspan=\"2\">\n                Cell Part\n            <\/td>\n            <td rowspan=\"2\">\n                Function\n            <\/td>\n            <td rowspan=\"2\">\n                Prokaryotes\n            <\/td>\n            <td colspan=\"2\">\n                Eukaryotes\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                Plants\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                Animals\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                plasma membrane\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                allows selective materials to enter and exit the cell\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                cytoplasm\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                gel-like cytosol and components of cell interior (except the nucleoid or nucleus)\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                ribosomes\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                make proteins\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                nucleoid\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                area where DNA is located<br>\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                X\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                <br>\n            <\/td>\n            <td>\n                <br>\n            <\/td>\n        <\/tr>\n    <\/tbody>\n<\/table>","caption":"Distinct differences occur between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, as well as, differences between plant and animal cells.","images":[],"footnotes":["<p>\n    here are"," some"," footnotes"," yay"," it works\n<\/p>"],"display_title":false}],"name":"Parts of Eukaryotic Cells","route":"\/sg\/introduction-to-biology-dev\/introduction-to-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells\/#parts-of-eukaryotic-cells","extra_properties":{"cmsItemId":5718918,"createdOn":"2018-05-10 17:12:00"},"header":"Parts of Eukaryotic Cells","summary_point":"","body":"","images":[]}],"name":"Introduction to Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells","route":"\/sg\/introduction-to-biology-dev\/introduction-to-prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells\/","extra_properties":{"cmsItemId":5718913,"createdOn":"2018-05-10 17:12:00"},"description":"","meta_description":""},{"block_type":"SectionBlock","id":20,"children":[{"block_type":"SuggestedReadingBlock","id":21,"children":[],"name":"Suggested Reading","route":"\/sg\/introduction-to-biology-dev\/cell-types-and-structures-keep-this-valid\/suggested-reading\/#suggested-reading","extra_properties":{"cmsItemId":5741360,"createdOn":"2018-05-10 17:12:00"},"body":"\"Khan Academy: the endomembrane system\" https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/science\/biology\/structure-of-a-cell\/tour-of-organelles\/a\/the-endomembrane-system\n\n<p>\n    \"Khan academy: Prokaryote structure\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/science\/biology\/bacteria-archaea\/prokaryote-structure\/a\/prokaryote-structure\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    \u201cOpenStax, Comparing Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells\u201d last modified February 25, 2014, http:\/\/cnx.org\/contents\/11a1ccc8-307f-4e88-ae8c-021cadbe7437@6.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n    Reece, Jane B., Lisa A.
